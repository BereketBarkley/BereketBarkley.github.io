    <p>Summary: The goal of our project is to analyze the opportunity SHSAT schools create for underprivileged students by race group. Certain race groups admit into the specialized schools at a higher rate. Some schools are more divers and some are less diverse. What do you notice? </p>
    <p>Data perspectives:
    Which race groups have a higher admittance rate?
    which schools are more diverse?
    How do class sizes and number of applicants affect this data?</p>
